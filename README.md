# Group Project 1: FunBrew


## Introduction

Have you and your friends or family ever been in the mood for a brew, but didn’t know where to go? Once you decided on a brewery (and, let’s be honest, it was probably the same one you always go to because you don’t know of any others), were you bored when you got there? We developed FunBrew to help solve your brewery boredom!
