            Beer fall into two categories: larger and ale. While the two are typically created using the same four base ingredients
            (yeast, malted barley, hops and water), they differ in how they are made . Thanks to this, there are hundreds of beer styles!
        </li>    
        <li>
            Ales are fermented with top-fermentin ale yeast at warmer temperatures. The type of yeast used to make ales, along with the warmer
            fermentation temperature, generally produces a fruiter, spicer flavor. Some of the different ale styles are: American Pale Ale (APA), New England India Pale Ale (NEIPA), 
            West Coast India Pale Ale (WCIPA), Imperial or Double India Pale Ale, American Wheat, Hefeweizen, Brown Ale and more!

           Largers are by far the most popular beers in the world. Lagers range in color from pale strawa to very dark. They are usually fermented with bottom-fermenting lager yeast
           at lower temperatures, which separates them from ales. Some of the different lagers styles are: American Lager, Vienna Style Lager, Pilsner, Imperial Pilsner, California Common,
           Bock, Doppelbock, Maibock, Marzen/Oktoberfest and more!  <a href="https://www.hy-vee.com/recipes-ideas/advice-how-tos/food-love/types-of-lagers"> Click here to learn more</a>

            The world's most expensive beer costs $503,300!!. That's right, the name of the beer is Allsopp's Artic Ale. This beer was brewed in 1875 for an Antarctic expedition, which

        </li>
        <li>
            The world's strongest beer is called 'Snake Venom' and it's made by Brewmeister with an alcohol ABV of 67.5%. It is brewed in Moray from smoked, peated malt using two
            varieties of yeast, one beer and one Champagne. Like other ultra high strenght beers it is frozen several times after the fermentation process and the ice crystals removed. 
        </li>
 
        <li>
           China is the largest beer consumer as a whole with an average annual consumption of 46 billion litters, which is twice the amount of the U.S. On the other hand,

                            Drinking stout could help fight cancer. What makes stout unique from other beers is its overwhelming, roasted flavor. The stout's flavor comes from the
                             roasted barley from that has not been malted. It also stands out from other beers as the only drink associated with fighting cancer. According to a study, 
                             drinking stout with your meals helps fight free radicals, which occurs when the body starts to metabolize the food.

                            Beer may be made of sugar, but drinking slow amounts lowers a personâ€™s risk for type 2 diabetes by 25%. Researchers observed that alcohol increased a person's adiponectin levels.
                             Adiponectin is a hormone that improves insulin sensitivity, protecting the body against developing Type 2 diabetes.
