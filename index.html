        <ul>
            <li>
                Beer fall into two categories: larger and ale. While the two are typically created using the same
                four base ingredients
                (yeast, malted barley, hops and water), they differ in how they are made . Thanks to this, there are
                hundreds of beer styles!
            </li>
            <li>
                Ales are fermented with top-fermentin ale yeast at warmer temperatures. The type of yeast used to
                make ales, along with the warmer
                fermentation temperature, generally produces a fruiter, spicer flavor. Some of the different ale
                styles are: American Pale Ale (APA), New England India Pale Ale (NEIPA),
                West Coast India Pale Ale (WCIPA), Imperial or Double India Pale Ale, American Wheat, Hefeweizen,
                Brown Ale and more!

            <li>
                Largers are by far the most popular beers in the world. Lagers range in color from pale strawa to
                very dark. They are usually fermented with bottom-fermenting lager yeast
                at lower temperatures, which separates them from ales. Some of the different lagers styles are:
                American Lager, Vienna Style Lager, Pilsner, Imperial Pilsner, California Common,
                Bock, Doppelbock, Maibock, Marzen/Oktoberfest and more!

                The world's most expensive beer costs $503,300!!. That's right, the name of the beer is Allsopp's
                Artic Ale. This beer was brewed in 1875 for an Antarctic expedition, which
                makes it a collector's item. Although is not for consumption anymore due to the long steeping
                period, over 50 different bidders from eBay fought for it.
            </li>
            <li>
                The world's strongest beer is called 'Snake Venom' and it's made by Brewmeister with an alcohol ABV
                of 67.5%. It is brewed in Moray from smoked, peated malt using two
                varieties of yeast, one beer and one Champagne. Like other ultra high strenght beers it is frozen
                several times after the fermentation process and the ice crystals removed.
            </li>
            <li>
                China is the largest beer consumer as a whole with an average annual consumption of 46 billion
                litters, which is twice the amount of the U.S. On the other hand,
                The Czech Republic leads the world in terms of beer consumption per person.

                could put anyone's health at risk, the moderate consumption of
                beer has shown to potentially prevent several diseases. Now keep in mind that for all beer's
                medicinal effects is best to consult your doctor

                        Drinking stout could help fight cancer. What makes stout unique from other beers is its
                        overwhelming, roasted flavor. The stout's flavor comes from the
                        roasted barley from that has not been malted. It also stands out from other beers as the
                        only drink associated with fighting cancer. According to a study,
                        drinking stout with your meals helps fight free radicals, which occurs when the body starts
                        to metabolize the food.

                        At this point, it may sound like one of the beer facts that can't be true, but beer does
                        have more medicinal effects. In the right amount and circumstances,
                        beer is good for the heart and blood vessels due to its alcohol content. For the average
                        person, an intake of less than 30 g of alcohol per day lowers the risk of
                        cardiovascular disease by 25% compared to nondrinkers.

                        An ischemic stroke starts when an artery in the brain gets blocked. Small amounts of alcohol
                        can be beneficial for patients who had a stroke caused by a clot blocking a blood vessel.

                        Beer may be made of sugar, but drinking slow amounts lowers a person's risk for type 2
                        diabetes by 25%. Researchers observed that alcohol increased a person's adiponectin levels.
                        Adiponectin is a hormone that improves insulin sensitivity, protecting the body against
                        developing Type 2 diabetes.

                        Moderate alcohol consumption increases HDL cholesterol in the blood. In detail, HDL
                        cholesterol acts as the scavenger in the bloodstream, eradicating harmful cholesterol.
                        Hence, high HDL levels provide many benefits to the average human's body.

                        your stomach from ulcers.
                        A small intake of 75 grams per week of beer reduces the risk of ulcers caused by a bacteria
                        known as H. Pylori.
